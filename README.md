# Automatic Traffic Light System

A web-based simulation of an automatic traffic light system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description
This project simulates a traffic light system with automatic color changes (red, yellow, green) using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior. The lights cycle every few seconds to mimic real-world traffic signals.

## How to Use
1. Open `TrafficLightSystem.html` in a web browser to view the simulation.
2. The traffic lights will automatically cycle through red (5s), green (5s), and yellow (2s).
3. Optionally, deploy to a web server or GitHub Pages for online access.

## Preview
The page displays three circular lights (red, yellow, green) that change automatically, with a note indicating the technologies used.
